Mission
- Build a privacy-first, local-first personal AI — a trustworthy “digital symbiont” that remembers, assists, and acts, owned by the individual.

Problem
- Users juggle fragmented notes, chats, and images. Cloud AI is opaque and risky for private knowledge. Most tools are chat-only with weak memory and little agency.

Solution
- Epoch runs locally, turning daily inputs (text/audio/images) into a personal memory base with fast semantic retrieval, and evolves toward proactive assistance and tool use.

Why Now
- Edge hardware is powerful; open models are capable; privacy expectations and regulation (GDPR/CCPA) demand local-first options.

Product (PoC → Product)
- v0.1 PoC: ingest → embed → store → retrieve; daily review.
- v0.2+: audio (Whisper), images (VLM), local LLM via Ollama; vector DB swap; evaluation baselines.
- v1.0: agents with safe tool-calls (calendar/web), context routing, encrypted data vault.

Moat
- Verifiable privacy (offline-by-default), user-owned portable data, open modular stack (ASR/Embeddings/DB/LLM), strong community and dev velocity.

Market
- Individual prosumers (second brain/PKM), privacy-sensitive teams (legal/health/R&D), edge deployments (education/government).

Business Model
- Open-core: free local core; premium add-ons (enterprise features, managed sync, evaluation packs, curated models), and partnerships.

Go-To-Market
- Developer-first distribution via GitHub and community; showcase practical workflows (daily review, meeting minutes → tasks). Partner with device makers and privacy-forward orgs.

Milestones
- Next 3–6 months: vector DB migration, audio/image pipelines, baseline evals, early pilot users.
- 6–12 months: agent tools, encrypted vault, integrations, edge bundles.

Ask
- Strategic partners and seed investment to accelerate productization and pilots while preserving the open, privacy-first ethos.
